In this exercise, you map the subsystem decomposition including the most important software components and classes to Java source code.

1. Create a Java project with packages for all components that you identified in your subsystem decomposition. Make sure to put each component in its own package.
2. Create the identified Java classes for each subsystem (package) including the most important attributes and method stubs. Make sure to follow Java naming conventions. Also add the identified references between the classes (remember: focus on low coupling and high cohesion)
3. Commit and push the source code until the given deadline.
Important: Make sure that your source code is consistent with the UML diagrams in your system design.

Please note: In this exercise, there are no test cases. Your score will be inserted manually by one of the teaching assistants after the deadline of the exercise.
