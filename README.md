In this repository I collect some most important tasks that I come across during my study regarding the area of software engineering/development. The focus is layed on system design, object design patterns, testing with JUnit5 and mock object pattern. 

These tasks helps me to understand 
- model abstractions of the software system with UML class diagrams
- process models in software development: agile (Scrum)
 
After practices I can 
- apply system design principles such as specification of the software architecture, usage of architectural patterns, and prioritization of design goals
- apply object design principles such as reuse, design patterns, and interface specification
- Write test cases using JUnit and apply testing patterns such as the mock object pattern
